- This website is created using the different web technologies such as : HTML5, CSS3 and JS ESE6, node environment, express.

### The required changes that I did are based on the project requirements from Udacity :

- Setting up project environment, making sure Node and packages installed, and included in server.js file.
- Added POST and GET routes to ensure correct retrieval of data from the server.
- Acquired API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website.
- Created async functions to fetch weather data and store it on my local server. 
- Set up a function that updated UI dynamically.
